	<h1>Learn How to Fork a Repository !</h1>
		<p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>
	<h2>Propose changes to someone else's project</h2>
		<p>A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fork the repository.</li>
	<li>Make the fix.</li>
	<li>Submit a pull request to the project owner.</li>
</ul>
<p> If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!</p>
